This is a project i made while following a guided project from Boot.Dev. It is object oriented programming and randomly creates a maze for you out of squares, and then randomly solves the maze 
for you automatically. 

For the most part this code matches closely with the solutions provided, however i've made some slight tweaks to make it my own. 

TO run this project you will need a working IDE that runs Python3 and you'll need the tkinter library installed as well. 

I hope you like it!
